			<h1>About Explore VR</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Explore VR is a web application providing state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies easy and convenient access to a range of VR and related data for planning, evaluation, and decision-making. Overall, this data-sharing effort seeks to increase knowledge about the public VR program and its role within the larger employment and disability service system within and across states and territories.</p>

<h2>Uses of Explore VR</h2>
<p>VR counselors can use the data portal to get information about other public employment services in their state.
VR staff can use Explore VR to compare their agency to other similarly structured VR agencies with respect to employment outcomes, agency partnerships, state demographics, and other data points, these results can ultimately be incorporated into their planning efforts.</p>

<h2>VR-RRTC</h2>
<p>Explore VR is part of the Vocational Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (VR-RRTC) at the Institute for Community Inclusion at UMass Boston (<a href="http://communityinclusion.org">www.communityinclusion.org</a>). The VR-RRTC is a national center that builds the capacity of the public VR program to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities. The VR-RRTC is funded by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) and the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) of the US Department of Education. Visit the VR-RRTC website (<a href="http://www.vr-rrtc.org">www.vr-rrtc.org</a>) for more information about the center’s policy research, training, and technical assistance efforts.</p>


<h2>The Open Data Initiative</h2>
<p>Explore VR is committed to the Open Data initiative that is being embraced by the U.S. government and around the nation. Our goal is to allow decision-makers, researchers and web builders access to all of the VR data that we collect. To that end, we release the data in its most raw form, as well as build useful applications to view the data. Because we take part in Open Data it is our hope that others will build and expand off of the work that we put forth.</p>
