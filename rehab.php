<h3>Rehabilitation Rates for all Individuals Exiting VR After Receiving Services and Special Populations by Type of Parent Agency (DSA)</h3>
<p>In the 2011 National Survey of State Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies we asked VR agencies to report where they are located within the government structure of their state—their Designated State Agency (DSA) or “parent agency.” Based on survey responses to this question we categorized VR agencies into 1 of 5 categories: Labor / Workforce, Independent (they do not have a parent agency), Human/Social Services, Education, or Other. We paired this data with RSA-911 rehabilitation rate data to analyze rehabilitation rates based on parent agency. Rehabilitation rate is the ratio of successful closures (Status 26) relative to the sum of successful closures and people not rehabilitated with an IPE (Status 28). We created two charts, one for general and combined agencies and one for blind agencies. Rehabilitation rates for the following population groups are specifically included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehabilitation Rate for all case closures [Status 26/(Status 26 +Status 28)] </li>
<li>Transition age people (14 to 24)</li>
<li>People ages 65 and older</li>
<li>People who received SSI at application</li>
<li>People who received SSDI at application</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking on the legend will allow you to manipulate the chart to only see data relevant to your needs or interests.</p>

<p><em>Note: Location data should not be used independently because of external factors (e.g., Order of Selection).</em></p>
